1. To sort the output by file size, we write ls -S, to sort it, starting
largest size first
2. By using touch, we create new files. A file argument that does not exist
is created empty. Unless -c or -h is supplied. 
Touch -a only changes the access time
touch -m Changes only the modification time
3. To find out in which directory we are, we use the pwd command 
In the knittl/ubuntu container, we start with /home/student
4. To switch from a directory to another, we can use the cd command  
cd .. leads me to the parent directory
cd ../.. leads me to the parent's parent directory
5. For switching to the /usr/bin directory, I can use cd /usr/bin as an 
absolute address, since it will lead me there, no matter where I currently am
Or I navigate my way by starting with pwd to check where I am, list the 
contents with ls-a and move path by path until I reach the directory
It's faster tho to use the absolute address
6. The used command is touch. If I want to list the information in long 
format, I use the ls -l command. 
7. The difference between paths ./lib, ../lib and /lin is:
./ lib Represents a subdirectory named "lib" in the current directory
../lib Represents a subdirectory named "lib" in the parent directory of the
current directory
/lib Represents an absolute path to the "lib" directory, starting from
the root
8. The things we used frequently so far are pwd, ls, ls -a, mkdir, touch, rm, cd
cd, as mentioned, leads to a directory
pwd shows me where I am right now
ls shows me what's in the directory where I am right now
ls -a shows the hidden content of a directory
mkdir makes a new directory
touch makes a new file
rm removes a file
